.SH DESCRIPTION

pmount ("policy mount") is a wrapper around the standard mount program which
permits normal users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab
entry.

pmount also supports encrypted devices which use dm-crypt and have
LUKS metadata. If a LUKS-capable
.B cryptsetup
is installed, pmount will use it to decrypt the device first and mount
the mapped unencrypted device instead.

.B pmount
is invoked like this:

.B pmount
.I device 
[
.I label
]

This will mount 
.I device
to a directory below /media if policy is met (see below). If 
.I label
is given, the mount point will be /media/label, otherwise it will be
/media/device.

The device will be mounted with the following flags: 
async,atime,nodev,noexec,noauto,nosuid,user,rw

Some applications like CD burners modify a raw device which must not be mounted
while the burning process is in progress. To prevent automatic mounting, pmount
offers a locking mechanism:
.B pmount \-\-lock 
.I device pid
will prevent the pmounting of 
.I device
until it is unlocked again using 
.B pmount \-\-unlock 
.I device pid\fR. The process id 
.I pid
assigns the lock to a particular process; this allows to lock a device by
several processes.

During mount, the list of locks is cleaned, i. e. all locks whose associated
process does not exist any more are removed. This prevents forgotten indefinite
locks from crashed programs.

.SH POLICY

The mount will succeed if all of the following conditions are met:

.IP \(bu 2
.I device
is a block device in /dev/
.IP \(bu 
.I device
is not in /etc/fstab (if it is, pmount executes \fB mount \fI device\fR as the
calling user to handle this transparently)
.IP \(bu
.I device
is not already mounted according to /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts
.IP \(bu
if the mount point already exists, there is no device already mounted at it
and the directory is empty 
.IP \(bu
.I device
is removable (USB, FireWire, or MMC device, or \fB/sys/block/\fIdrive\fB/removable\fR
is 1) or whitelisted in
.B /etc/pmount.allow\fR.
.IP \(bu
.I device
is not locked

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-r, \-\-read-only
Force the device to be mounted read only. If neither \-r nor \-w is
specified, the kernel will choose an appropriate default.

.TP
.B \-w, \-\-read-write
Force the device to be mounted read/write. If neither \-r nor \-w is
specified, the kernel will choose an appropriate default.

.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sync
Mount the device with the 
.B sync
option, i. e. without write caching. Default is 
.B async
(write-back). With this option, write operations are much slower and
due to the massive increase of updates of inode/FAT structures, flash
devices may suffer heavily if you write large files. This option is
intended to make it safe to just rip out USB drives without proper
unmounting.

.TP
.B \-A, \-\-noatime
Mount the device with the 
.B noatime
option. Default is 
.B atime\fR. 

.TP
.B \-e, \-\-exec
Mount the device with the 
.B exec
option. Default is 
.B noexec\fR. 

.TP
.B \-t \fIfilesystem\fR, \fB\-\-type \fIfilesystem
Mount as specified file system type. The file system type is automatically
determined if this option is not given.

.TP
.B \-c \fIcharset\fR, \fB\-\-charset \fIcharset
Use given I/O character set (default: 
.B utf8 
if called in an UTF-8 locale, otherwise mount default). This
corresponds with the mount option
.B iocharset\fR. This option is ignored for file systems that do not
support setting the character set (see
.B mount
(8) for details).

.TP
.B \-u \fIumask\fR, \fB\-\-umask \fIumask\fR
Use specified umask instead of the default one. For UDF, the default
is '007', for VFAT and NTFS the default is '077'. This value is
ignored for file systems which do not support setting an umask.

.TP
.B \-\-passphrase \fIfile
If the device is encrypted (dm-crypt with LUKS metadata), read the
passphrase from specified
.I file
instead of prompting at the terminal.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit successfully.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Enable verbose debug messages.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the current version number and exit successfully.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B /etc/pmount.allow
List of devices (one device per line) which are additionally permitted
for pmounting.
