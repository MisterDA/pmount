.TH pumount 1 "August 27, 2004" "Martin Pitt"

.SH NAME
pumount \- umount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pumount
[
.I options
]
.I device

.SH DESCRIPTION

pumount is a wrapper around the standard umount program which permits normal
users to umount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. 

pumount also supports encrypted devices which use dm-crypt and have
LUKS metadata. If a LUKS-capable
.B cryptsetup
is installed, pumount will umount the mapped device instead and call
cryptsetup to close the decrypted device afterwards.

.B pumount
expects the
.I device
as its only argument. This will umount 
.I device
from a directory below /media if policy is met (see below). 

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lazy
Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now,
and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy
anymore.  (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit successfully.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Enable verbose debug messages.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the current version number and exit successfully.

.SH POLICY

The umount will succeed if all of the following conditions are met:

.IP \(bu 2
.I device
is a block device in /dev/ (it does not need to exist if
.B \-l
is supplied)
.IP \(bu 
.I device
is not in /etc/fstab (if it is, pmount executes \fB umount \fI device\fR as the
calling user to handle this transparently)
.IP \(bu
.I device
is mounted according to /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts with the calling user's uid
.IP \(bu
mount point is in /media
