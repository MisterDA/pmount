.TH pumount 1 "August 27, 2004" "Martin Pitt"

.SH NAME
pumount \- umount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pumount
[
.I options
]
.I device

.SH DESCRIPTION

pumount is a wrapper around the standard umount program which permits normal
users to umount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry.

pumount also supports encrypted devices which use dm-crypt and have
LUKS metadata. If a LUKS-capable
.B cryptsetup
is installed, pumount will umount the mapped device instead and call
cryptsetup to close the decrypted device afterwards.

.B pumount
expects the
.I device
as its only argument. This will umount
.I device
from a directory below
.R @MEDIADIR@ if policy is met (see below).

Please note that, as with
.BR pmount ,
you can use labels and uuids as described in
.B fstab
(5) for devices present in
.IR /etc/fstab .
In this case, the device name need to match exactly the corresponding
entry in
.IR /etc/fstab ,
including the
.I LABEL=
or
.I UUID=
part.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lazy
Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now,
and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy
anymore.  (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)
.B IMPORTANT NOTES
This option should not be used unless you
.B really
know what you are doing, as chances are high that it will result in
data loss on the removable drive. Please run
.B pumount
manually and wait until it finishes. In addition,
.B pumount
will not
.I luksClose
a device which was unmounted lazily.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit successfully.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Enable verbose debug messages.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the current version number and exit successfully.

.SH POLICY

The umount will succeed if all of the following conditions are met:

.IP \(bu 2
.I device
is a block device in /dev/ (it does not need to exist if
.B \-l
is supplied)
.IP \(bu
.I device
is not in /etc/fstab (if it is, pmount executes \fB umount \fI device\fR as the
calling user to handle this transparently)
.IP \(bu
.I device
is mounted according to /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts with the calling user's uid
.IP \(bu
mount point is in
.R @MEDIADIR@

.SH PUMOUNT AND MISSING DEVICES

.B pumount
now supports unmounting devices that have gone missing for some
reason, such as a brutal removal of the device, or a kernel/hardware
problem. Just specify the mount point as argument for
.B pumount\fR.
