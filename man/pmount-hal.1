.SH NAME
pmount-hal \- HAL-aware wrapper around pmount

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pmount-hal
.I device
[
.I pmount options
]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pmount
("policy mount") is a wrapper around the standard mount program which
permits normal users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab
entry.

.B pmount-hal 
extends pmount by making it work together with hal (Hardware Abstration Layer).
.B pmount-hal
will ask hal about values for certain mount flags (like
.B noatime\fR and \fBasync\fR) and the prefered mount point name and
pass it to
.B pmount\fR, thus respecting the configured device storage policy.

The first parameter (\fIdevice\fR) must be the HAL UDI or the device
node of the device to be mounted. All further parameters are passed to
pmount unchanged.

.SH WARNING

As 
.B pmount-hal
uses 
.BR pmount (1)
to mount the given device, 
.B it is not possible to unmount it with hal !
You need to use either
.BR pumount (1)
or directly
.BR umount (1)
to unmount the devices mounted by
.BR pmount-hal .
This is the cause of the following error messages when unmounting with 
.IR hal\ umount :

.TP 2
.B *
Device to unmount is not in /media/.hal-mtab so it is not mounted by HAL

.TP
.B *
Cannot open /media/.hal-mtab

.TP
.B *
Cannot obtain lock on /media/.hal-mtab



.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
.B PMOUNT_DEBUG
Setting this variable to a nonempty value will enable debug messages.
