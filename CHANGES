0.8
---
- unbreak locking, this created ".created_by_pmount" stamps in the
  locking directories
- accept pumount by label name
- accept pmount by mount path (only in /media)
- added --umask option
- renamed template.pot to pmount.pot to match translation domain
- support a whitelist in /etc/pmount.allow

0.7.2
-----
- updated translations from Rosetta: ca, es_ES
- added new translations from Rosetta: cs, es, fr, hr, it_IT, nb

0.7.1
-----
- pmount-hal: consider a directory empty if it only contains a
  .created-by-pmount file; this makes it work with unmounting using
  umount instead of pumount

0.7
---
- support --exec/-e option
- rewrote pmount-hal in C, now it runs 10 times faster

0.6
---
- pmount-hal: use hal-supplied file system type (if present) to speed up
  mounting and to avoid bogus error messages in kernel log
- mount vfat with 'quiet' option
- support pmount/pumount'ing mount points
- added Catalan translation, thanks to Eduard Duran
- added Spanish translation, thanks to Gustavo de Lama and Jorge
  González González

0.5.1
-----
- pmount: do not allow empty media labels; this allowed to mount a
  device directly under /media if /media was empty

0.5
---
- use stamp files to mark directories created by pmount and only
  remove a mount point directory if it contains a stamp file
- use the given device name as default mount point name instead of the
  symlink-resolved one
- i18n support
- added German translation

0.4.4
-----
- pmount-hal: resolve symlinks before checking mount point directories
- use umask "077" instead of "007" for VFAT and NTFS volumes; this allows e. g.
  to use ssh keys on USB sticks
- if a mount with given iocharset fails, try again without; there were reports
  of failed vfat mounts when giving iocharset

0.4.3
-----
- pmount-hal: when checking for already existing mount points, also
  accept existing, but empty directories (if nothing is mounted at
  them)

0.4.2
-----
- pumount: allow to unmount any device if called as root

0.4.1
-----
- consistently use the realpath() of devices for all operations but
  transparent mount fallback

0.4
---
- pmount: added --noatime option
- Makefile: support PREFIX
- Makefile: install manapges, too
- Makefile: add uninstall target
- added pmount-hal (incl. manpage)

0.3
---
- pmount: added option -a/--async for asynchronous mounting
- pmount: added option -t for selecting a file system
- added NTFS support
- pmount: added option -c/--charset for selecting the iocharset;
  default to 'utf8' when pmount is executed in an UTF-8 locale,
  otherwise default to mount default
- pmount: do not fail if a device is handled in /etc/fstab, but a
  label is supplied; merely print a warning

0.2.2
-----
- mount CD-ROM file systems without umask parameter (this does not work)
- added and documented dynamic debug option -d, use dynamic debug output
  everywhere
- pumount: now use getopt_long() for option parsing, added -d and -h

0.2.1
-----
- version 0.2 was not published, had a major policy hole: in some cases it
  allowed to mount partitions on fixed disks
- policy.c: rewrote find_sysfs_device() to check minor device number, too

0.2 [DO NOT USE]
----------------
- major refactorization to clean up the code
- consolidated error return codes
- pmount: added --lock/--unlock commands
- device is regarded as removable also if /sys/block/drive/removable is 1
- mount devices with umask=007

0.1
---
- fixed /dev/ path checking: now use the real path of the device node, not the
  path supplied on the command line
- pmount: don't try to mount all file systems with the uid and gid options,
  this does not work on ext3, ext2, reiserfs, xfs, and jfs; try two separate
  mount commands now
- pumount: added option -l to support lazy unmounting
- pumount: changed policy: 
  * device must be mounted by the same uid that attempts to pumount
  * device node does not need to exist and be removeable any more (because the
    device node cannot be checked any more if device was already ripped out)

0.0.8
-----
- use root privileges also for checking that the existing mount point is empty,
  since normal user might not be allowed to read the directory

0.0.7
-----
- replaced all str[n]cat() and str[n]cpy() with snprintf() calls; thanks to
  Matt Zimmerman for the patch

0.0.6
-----
- added support for CD-ROM file systems (udf and iso9660)
- require mount points to be empty before mount

0.0.5
-----
- now also handle devices in /etc/fstab, transparently call mount/umount in
  this case

0.0.4
-----
- drop effective user id to normal user until root is really needed
- added proper online help
- added manpages

0.0.3
-----
- pumount: added similar suid check 
- pumount: delete mount point after umounting
- determine real path of devices before checking them
- pmount: mount with proper uid and gid options

0.0.2
-----
- pmount: added check if really suid, print an error if not
- pmount: set the real user id to root before executing mount (mount
  refuses to mount a device if real uid != root)

0.0.1
-----
- initial release
