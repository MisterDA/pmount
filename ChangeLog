0.9.18
-----------
- clarify the position about symlinks in /etc/fstab in pmount.1 and 
  try to provide a better error message when a mountpoint is found
  in /etc/fstab
- vfat now uses utf8 rather than iocharset=utf8 when applicable, to
  avoid getting a case-sensitive filesystem. In addition, charset
  iso8859-1 is now used for VFAT for all cases when the charset is not
  specified, or is utf8
- finally fix the symlinks in /etc/fstab problem.
- pulling new translations from Rosetta.
	
0.9.17
-----------
- removed obnoxious symlink lookup for fstab entries.
- now using libblkid where available to detect FS type (that's what
  mount is doing). This way we'll have less error messages (nearly
  none, AFAICS), and we won't have wrong FS detection (it happens).
- fix a problem with lookup for fstab entries
- do not look for a mountpoint in etc/fstab if we know a path is
  a device (prevents hanging on stale network mounts)
- pulled translations from Rosetta
- using ntfs-3g if /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g is found.

0.9.16
-----------
- added support for fmask and dmask for filesystems that support it,
  based on a patch by Suren A. Chilingaryan <csa@dside.dyndns.org>
- NTFS now uses nls= instead of iocharset=
- support for ntfsmount (via the ntfs-fuse fs type) and ntfs-3g 
  (via ntfs-3g)
- included the patch by Dan Keder <keder@fi.muni.cz> for listing 
  mounted removable devices, in the fashion of mount (with some edits)
- pumount now works with uuids/labels.
- /etc/pmount.allow now supports fully globs (7)

0.9.15
-----------
- fix problems with the missing bus symlink in recent kernels
- now, pmount keeps track of the encrypted volume it did luksOpen, and
  pumount won't luksClose them unless explicitly asked to (with the
  --luks-force option).

0.9.14
-----------
- pmount: support the 'omfs' file system
- applied patch from Tim Phipps <tim@phipps-hutton.freeserve.co.uk> to
  fix pumount when /media is a symlink.
- use errors=continue when applicable to prevent carefully crafted fs 
  to cause kernel panics.
- some typo fixes
- -p is now a shortcut for --passphrase
- document why for some filesystems, pmount makes the kernel complain.
- use the realpath implementation from the mount utility for security
  reasons (man 3 realpath says 'Avoid using this function.')
- pulling recent translations from Rosetta; adding (partial)
  translations for: 
  * Basque
  * Persian
  * Norwegian
  * Telugu
  * Turkish

0.9.13
------
- pmount-hal: minor change to build with dbus 0.91

0.9.3
-----
- pmount: close an already opened LUKS device if mount failed
- pmount: print a proper error message if mapped device already exists
- pmount: do not explicitly mount with "rw" or "ro" options since the
  default usually does the right thing
- pmount: add -r and -w switches

0.9.2
-----
- Switched version control to bazaar-ng (http://www.bazaar-ng.org);
  publicly accessible branch is at
  http://people.ubuntu.com/~pitti/bzr/pmount/
- pmount-hal: ignore invalid file systems, autodetect in this case
- Mark JFS and iso9660 as iocharset-capable

---
- pmount-hal: ported to new hal 0.5 and dbus 0.32 API
- integrate cryptsetup (with LUKS extension) if device is encrypted
  with dmcrypt and LUKS metadata
- pmount: mount vfat with shortname=winnt option
- pmount-hal: use volume.policy.mount_filesystem instead of
  volume.fstype
- always build the POT file, delete it on "make clean"
- Makefile: added "dist" target

0.8
---
- unbreak locking, this created ".created_by_pmount" stamps in the
  locking directories
- accept pumount by label name
- accept pmount by mount path (only in /media)
- added --umask option
- renamed template.pot to pmount.pot to match translation domain
- support a whitelist in /etc/pmount.allow

0.7.2
-----
- updated translations from Rosetta: ca, es_ES
- added new translations from Rosetta: cs, es, fr, hr, it_IT, nb

0.7.1
-----
- pmount-hal: consider a directory empty if it only contains a
  .created-by-pmount file; this makes it work with unmounting using
  umount instead of pumount

0.7
---
- support --exec/-e option
- rewrote pmount-hal in C, now it runs 10 times faster

0.6
---
- pmount-hal: use hal-supplied file system type (if present) to speed up
  mounting and to avoid bogus error messages in kernel log
- mount vfat with 'quiet' option
- support pmount/pumount'ing mount points
- added Catalan translation, thanks to Eduard Duran
- added Spanish translation, thanks to Gustavo de Lama and Jorge
  González González

0.5.1
-----
- pmount: do not allow empty media labels; this allowed to mount a
  device directly under /media if /media was empty

0.5
---
- use stamp files to mark directories created by pmount and only
  remove a mount point directory if it contains a stamp file
- use the given device name as default mount point name instead of the
  symlink-resolved one
- i18n support
- added German translation

0.4.4
-----
- pmount-hal: resolve symlinks before checking mount point directories
- use umask "077" instead of "007" for VFAT and NTFS volumes; this allows e. g.
  to use ssh keys on USB sticks
- if a mount with given iocharset fails, try again without; there were reports
  of failed vfat mounts when giving iocharset

0.4.3
-----
- pmount-hal: when checking for already existing mount points, also
  accept existing, but empty directories (if nothing is mounted at
  them)

0.4.2
-----
- pumount: allow to unmount any device if called as root

0.4.1
-----
- consistently use the realpath() of devices for all operations but
  transparent mount fallback

0.4
---
- pmount: added --noatime option
- Makefile: support PREFIX
- Makefile: install manapges, too
- Makefile: add uninstall target
- added pmount-hal (incl. manpage)

0.3
---
- pmount: added option -a/--async for asynchronous mounting
- pmount: added option -t for selecting a file system
- added NTFS support
- pmount: added option -c/--charset for selecting the iocharset;
  default to 'utf8' when pmount is executed in an UTF-8 locale,
  otherwise default to mount default
- pmount: do not fail if a device is handled in /etc/fstab, but a
  label is supplied; merely print a warning

0.2.2
-----
- mount CD-ROM file systems without umask parameter (this does not work)
- added and documented dynamic debug option -d, use dynamic debug output
  everywhere
- pumount: now use getopt_long() for option parsing, added -d and -h

0.2.1
-----
- version 0.2 was not published, had a major policy hole: in some cases it
  allowed to mount partitions on fixed disks
- policy.c: rewrote find_sysfs_device() to check minor device number, too

0.2 [DO NOT USE]
----------------
- major refactorization to clean up the code
- consolidated error return codes
- pmount: added --lock/--unlock commands
- device is regarded as removable also if /sys/block/drive/removable is 1
- mount devices with umask=007

0.1
---
- fixed /dev/ path checking: now use the real path of the device node, not the
  path supplied on the command line
- pmount: don't try to mount all file systems with the uid and gid options,
  this does not work on ext3, ext2, reiserfs, xfs, and jfs; try two separate
  mount commands now
- pumount: added option -l to support lazy unmounting
- pumount: changed policy: 
  * device must be mounted by the same uid that attempts to pumount
  * device node does not need to exist and be removeable any more (because the
    device node cannot be checked any more if device was already ripped out)

0.0.8
-----
- use root privileges also for checking that the existing mount point is empty,
  since normal user might not be allowed to read the directory

0.0.7
-----
- replaced all str[n]cat() and str[n]cpy() with snprintf() calls; thanks to
  Matt Zimmerman for the patch

0.0.6
-----
- added support for CD-ROM file systems (udf and iso9660)
- require mount points to be empty before mount

0.0.5
-----
- now also handle devices in /etc/fstab, transparently call mount/umount in
  this case

0.0.4
-----
- drop effective user id to normal user until root is really needed
- added proper online help
- added manpages

0.0.3
-----
- pumount: added similar suid check 
- pumount: delete mount point after umounting
- determine real path of devices before checking them
- pmount: mount with proper uid and gid options

0.0.2
-----
- pmount: added check if really suid, print an error if not
- pmount: set the real user id to root before executing mount (mount
  refuses to mount a device if real uid != root)

0.0.1
-----
- initial release
