This directory is meant to contain informal, usually more-or-less
interactive tests for pmount and relatives. This is not a real test
suite, rather a big help for development and most especially bugfixes.

A check_fstab subdirectory is included in the git repository but not
in the tarball, mostly because symlinks are not handled gracefully by
automake (for good reasons too).
