.SH NAME
pmount \- mount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pmount
[

.I device

.B pmount
[

]
.I device label

.B pmount \-\-lock
[

.I device pid

.SH DESCRIPTION

pmount ("policy mount") is a wrapper around the standard mount program which
permits normal users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab
entry.

.B pmount
is invoked like this:

.B pmount
.I device 
[
.I label
]

This will mount 
.I device
to a directory below /media if policy is met (see below). If 
.I label
is given, the mount point will be /media/label, otherwise it will be
/media/device.

The device will be mounted with the following flags: 
sync,atime,nodev,exec,noauto,nosuid,user,rw

Some applications like CD burners modify a raw device which must not be mounted
while the burning process is in progress. To prevent automatic mounting, pmount
offers a locking mechanism:
.B pmount \-\-lock 
.I device pid
will prevent the pmounting of 
.I device
until it is unlocked again using 
.B pmount \-\-unlock 
.I device pid\fR. The process id 
.I pid
assigns the lock to a particular process; this allows to lock a device by
several processes.

During mount, the list of locks is cleaned, i. e. all locks whose associated
process does not exist any more are removed. This prevents forgotten indefinite
locks from crashed programs.

.SH POLICY

The mount will succeed if all of the following conditions are met:

.IP \(bu 2
.I device
is a block device in /dev/
.IP \(bu 
.I device
is not in /etc/fstab (if it is, pmount executes \fB mount \fI device\fR as the
calling user to handle this transparently)
.IP \(bu
.I device
is not already mounted according to /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts
.IP \(bu
if the mount point already exists, there is no device already mounted at it
and the directory is empty 
.IP \(bu
.I device
is removable (USB or FireWire device, or \fB/sys/block/\fIdrive\fB/removable\fR
is 1)
.IP \(bu
.I device
is not locked

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-a, \-\-async
Mount the device with the 
.B async
option, i. e. with write caching. Default is 
.B sync
(write-through) for safety reasons. With this option, write
operations are much faster, but since users tend to rip out their USB drives
without proper unmounting, you should use this option with care.

.TP
.B \-A, \-\-noatime
Mount the device with the 
.B noatime
option. Default is 
.B atime\fR. 

.TP
.B \-e, \-\-exec
Mount the device with the 
.B exec
option. Default is 
.B noexec\fR. 

.TP
.B \-t \fIfilesystem\fR, \fB\-\-type \fIfilesystem
Mount as specified file system type. The file system type is automatically
determined if this option is not given.

.TP
.B \-c \fIcharset\fR, \fB\-\-charset \fIcharset
use given I/O character set (default: 
.B utf8 
if called in an UTF-8 locale, otherwise mount default). This
corresponds with the mount option
.B iocharset\fR. This option is ignored for file systems that do not
support setting the character set (see
.B mount
(8) for details).

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit successfully.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Enable verbose debug messages.
