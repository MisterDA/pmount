	* policy.c (fstab_has_device): 
	Remove symlink resolution in /etc/fstab, as this necessary makes
	pmount fail in case one tries to mount directly the target of a
	symlink present in /etc/fstab.

	* policy.c (device_whitelisted): 
	Now using fnmatch to look for whitelisted devices in
	/etc/pmount.allow. Fixed the regexp accordingly.

	* pmount.c (do_mount): 
	now takes two extra arguments, fmask and dmask, that can safely
	default to NULL. Changed all corresponding calls.
	
	(main): 
	added --fmask --dmask arguments, made the corresponding changes in
	pmount-hal.c  

	* fs.h, fs.c: 
	Heavy changes in the FS strucure:
	- support_iocharset is replaced by iocharset_format, the
	  corresponding format string
	- fdmask is a format string corresponding to the fdmask options
	- skip_autodetect is used to explicitly exclude FS types from
	  autodetection 
	
	Made corresponding changes in fs.c + ntfs-fuse and ntfs-3g.

	* luks.c: 
	Add luks_create_lockfile, luks_has_lockfile, and the like to deal
	with luks lock files.

	* luks.c (luks_release): 
	Add a force parameter to force the luksClosing of the device even
	if pmount detects it didn't luksOpen it in the first place.
	Modified pmount.c and pumount.c accordingly.
	
	* pmount.c (main): 
	Create a special 'lockfile' when pmount luksOpen a luks

	* realpath.c:
